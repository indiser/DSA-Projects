# 🚀 Complete DSA → FAANG Roadmap  

A structured **12-month journey** from absolute beginner to **FAANG interview-ready**, built on **DSA projects, core CS concepts, and system design**.  

This roadmap is based on the original **Complete DSA Project Roadmap (PDF)** with added **improvements**:  
✔️ Competitive programming practice  
✔️ Core CS fundamentals (OS, DBMS, Networks)  
✔️ Cloud & DevOps basics  
✔️ Mock interviews + behavioral prep  
✔️ Portfolio polish (GitHub, blogs, deployments)

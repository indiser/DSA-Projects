[cite_start]This repository is my personal implementation of the comprehensive project-based learning roadmap detailed in the source PDFs[cite: 162]. It's a structured approach to mastering the skills required for top-tier software engineering roles by combining theoretical knowledge with practical, hands-on projects.

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

[cite_start]This portfolio is built on a philosophy of structured, incremental learning[cite: 163].

* [cite_start]**Progressive Difficulty**: The projects are sequenced to start with fundamental data structures and gradually introduce more complex algorithms and system design concepts, ensuring a strong foundation before tackling advanced topics[cite: 320].
* [cite_start]**Practical Application**: Each project is designed to solve a real-world problem, cementing theoretical knowledge by applying it to practical challenges like social network analysis, route planning, and distributed systems[cite: 320].
* [cite_start]**Interview-Focused**: The selection of projects and the DSA concepts covered are directly aligned with the skills assessed in technical interviews at FAANG and other top tech companies[cite: 162, 298].

## 🛠️ Technologies Demonstrated

This repository showcases proficiency in the following technologies:

* **C++ (Modern C++17)**
    * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
    * Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms.
    * Memory management with RAII and smart pointers.
    * Modern features like structured bindings and lambdas.
* **CMake**
    * Creating robust, cross-platform build systems.
    * Managing project targets and dependencies.
    * Automatically fetching and linking third-party libraries like Google Test using `FetchContent`.
* **Google Test**
    * Writing and running unit tests to ensure code correctness and maintainability.
    * Using test fixtures to create a clean testing environment for each case.
